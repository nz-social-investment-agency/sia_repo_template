This folder is used to store output that has gone through the IDI signout process. This helps the team distinguish between output that has only been seen by the developers and output that has been distributed more widely.

Note that this folder would need to be added to .gitignore when you publish the code so that data/output is not included in the repository. The reason it is shown here is so you can download a zip file and drop the folder structure into the IDI without creating it from scratch.
